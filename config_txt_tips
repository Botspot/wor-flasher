Setting your overclock too high will prevent your Pi from booting. This is no big deal - just unplug the SD card and reduce the settings in its config.txt file, then boot it again.
Each Pi4 has a different limit, but nearly all of them can handle a 2GHz overclock. 
To overclock, just copy the settings (without the name at the top), and paste the settings at the bottom of config.txt

Note: WoR does not use the GPU, so overclocking it won't make a noticeable difference.

Pi4:

Simple 2.1GHz overclock, very stable: (for average user)
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2147
gpu_freq=700

Medium overclock, still quite stable: (for power users feeling average overclock might be too slow)

arm_freq=2300
gpu_freq=750
gpu_mem=32
over_voltage=14
force_turbo=1

Maximum settings, prone to freezing: (For extreme users, possibly dangerous, highest stable overclock as a average user can go without tweaking the OS)

initial_turbo=60
over_voltage=15
arm_freq_min=100
arm_freq=2350
gpu_freq=800
gpu_mem=512
